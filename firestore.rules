/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and role-based access control.
 * Data shape validation is relaxed to enable rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Sales accounts are stored in the top-level `/accounts-db/{accountId}` collection.
 * - Contacts are stored in the top-level `/contacts/{contactId}` collection.
 * - Products are stored in the top-level `/products/{productId}` collection.
 * - Account product notes are stored in the top-level `/account-products/{accountProductId}` collection.
 * - Call notes are stored in the top-level `/call-notes/{callNoteId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - All accounts, contacts, products, account product notes, and call notes are publicly readable.
 * - Writes (create, update, delete) to accounts, contacts, products, account product notes, and call notes are disallowed (for now) and must be enabled with stricter role-based access controls in the future.
 * - Listing of any collection is allowed for all users, including those not signed in.
