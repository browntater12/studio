/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and explicit access control.
 * All read and write operations require authentication.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database contains top-level collections for accounts, contacts, product notes, products, shipping locations, and call notes.
 * User profiles are stored under /users/{userId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All data access (read and write) is restricted to authenticated users.
 * - Public access to any collection is disallowed.
 * - Data validation is limited to relational integrity (ownership and IDs) during this prototyping phase.
