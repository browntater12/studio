/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles, public read access for products,
 * and authenticated access for other collections related to sales data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /accounts-db/{accountId}: Sales accounts, accessible only to authenticated users.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Contacts associated with accounts, accessible only to authenticated users.
 * - /account-products/{accountProductId}: Notes about products for specific accounts, accessible only to authenticated users.
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly accessible product catalog.
 * - /call-notes/{callNoteId}: Call notes linked to accounts, accessible only to authenticated users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Products are publicly readable but not writable except with admin privileges (not yet implemented).
 * - All other data is accessible only to authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   - The rules do not require denormalization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *   - Drafts vs. published content is not a concern in this data model.
