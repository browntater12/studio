/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes rapid prototyping by focusing on authorization and skipping data validation.
 * It assumes an evolving data model and enforces access control based on simple ownership or public read access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of several top-level collections: `users`, `accounts-db`, `contacts`, `account-products`, `products`, and `call-notes`.
 * Each collection stores documents representing entities like user profiles, accounts, contacts, product notes, products, and call notes.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are strictly owned by the respective user.
 * - Read access to products is public. Write access is restricted (TODO).
 * - All other collections (`accounts-db`, `contacts`, `account-products`, `call-notes`) allow unauthenticated access for writes, and public reads.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  None required for this ruleset.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Not applicable in this ruleset. All data is stored in top-level collections.
