/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 *              allows public read access for products, and requires authentication for
 *              managing accounts, contacts, and product notes.
 * @dataStructure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information, accessible only to the user.
 *   - /accounts-db/{accountId}: Stores sales accounts, accessible only to authenticated users.
 *   - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact information, accessible only to authenticated users.
 *   - /account-products/{accountProductId}: Stores notes about products for accounts, accessible only to authenticated users.
 *   - /products/{productId}: Stores product catalog, publicly readable but only writable by authenticated users.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed.
 *   - Public read access is granted to the /products collection to allow unauthenticated browsing.
 *   - All write operations (create, update, delete) on accounts, contacts, and product notes require authentication.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   - The 'AccountProductNote' entity requires both 'accountId' and 'productId' to enforce the relation,
 *     and the rules validate that these fields are correctly set on creation.
