/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure authorization while permitting flexible data shapes to enable rapid prototyping.
 * It uses a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and allows public read access to product catalogs.
 * Access to accounts and contacts is unrestricted, as the application has not specified ownership or role-based access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profiles, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /accounts-db/{accountId}: Stores sales accounts. Write access is unrestricted.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contacts, linked to accounts by accountNumber. Write access is unrestricted.
 * - /accounts-db/{accountId}/products/{productId}: Stores product notes specific to an account. Write access is unrestricted.
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores the global product catalog, publicly readable with unrestricted write access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to protect user privacy.
 * - Public read access is granted to the product catalog to facilitate easy access to product information.
 * - The absence of defined ownership or roles for accounts and contacts results in unrestricted write access to these collections.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Not applicable in this ruleset, as the current authorization model does not require it.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Not applicable in this ruleset, as there are no private and public data variations.
