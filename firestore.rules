/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and role-based access control.
 * It is designed for prototyping and rapid iteration, so data shape validation is relaxed.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /accounts-db/{accountId}: Sales accounts, publicly readable but writable only by authorized users.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Contacts, publicly readable but writable only by authorized users.
 * - /account-products/{accountProductId}: Product notes for accounts, publicly readable but writable only by authorized users.
 * - /products/{productId}: Global product catalog, publicly readable but not writable via the client.
 * - /call-notes/{callNoteId}: Call notes linked to accounts, publicly readable but writable only by authorized users.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied.
 * - All write operations require authentication and authorization.
 * - The rules explicitly define all five granular permissions (get, list, create, update, delete) for each path.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To avoid costly `get()` calls, it's recommended to denormalize authorization data (e.g., account ownership)
 * directly onto the documents being secured. For example, add an `ownerId` field to the `/accounts-db/{accountId}` documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * For data that has both private and public aspects, consider using separate collections. For example, a private
 * `/users/{userId}/drafts` subcollection and a public `/published_articles` top-level collection.
